# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Hi there, my name's Adam (pronouns he/him). I've been a fan of videogames since I was a kid, with a lot of my childhood spent playing games like Mario Kart, Smash Bros. and Plants vs. Zombies. At school whenever I was bored, I'd often draw ideas I had for characters in video game ideas I'd have, eventually evolving into an interest in becoming a game designer. I've had some experience with game design, as in high school I made a horror game in Blender as part of a class project, but I'm hoping this class will give me the opportunity to further expand my skills when it comes to the subject.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [X] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. I'm hoping that this class will give me the opportunity to get a better grasp of understanding the factors that go into coding a video game. As a game design major, I want to grasp what kinds of things the people that I'll be working with will be using to make the ideas I have a reality.

4. I'm not nervous about much right now. I'm pretty excited actually.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. In community college I learned how to use both Java and a bit of Python. I have no experience in any other languages.

2. I created a game in Blender several years ago, and I tried to get into GameMaker during summer.

3. N/A

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. N/A

2. The management of a game's scope to make it possible with the parameters given.

3. I am familiar with the term but don't have an exact definition.

4. A programming style that utilizes objects (int, double, String, etc.)

5. A program architecture where content inputted in the view is put into the controller and interpreted so it can be used in the model.
