# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

Hi there, my name's Adam (pronouns he/him). I've been a fan of videogames since I was a kid, with a lot of my childhood spent playing games like Mario Kart, Smash Bros. and Plants vs. Zombies. At school whenever I was bored, I'd often draw ideas I had for characters in video game ideas I'd have, eventually evolving into an interest in becoming a game designer. I've had some experience with game design, as in high school I made a horror game in Blender as part of a class project, but I'm hoping this class will give me the opportunity to further expand my skills when it comes to the subject.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [X] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?

I'm hoping that this class will give me the opportunity to get a better grasp of understanding the factors that go into coding a video game. As a game design major, I want to grasp what kinds of things the people that I'll be working with will be using to make the ideas I have a reality.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

Not much right now. I'm pretty excited actually.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)

In community college I learned how to use both Java and a bit of Python. I have no experience in any other languages.

2. Game development (any engine)

I created a game in Blender several years ago.

3. Unity

N/A

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document

2. Scope management

3. Iteration

4. Object-Oriented programming

5. Model-View-Controller architecture
